# Casper-Network

- The first Milestone of the three that we have planned within the migration of Minteandome technology, with the aim of making it compatible with Casper Network, is expected to be without a technical deliverable (as it appears on the DEVxDAO Portal).

 

The purpose of the first Milestone is to obtain capital support with which to refocus part of the technical team towards the migration to Rust.
